My name is Noam Cohen. When not geeking around I really like:
- Crossfit, Rockclimbing, traveling and any extreme sports
- Electronic music and especially Bass
- Werder Bremen (!) the legendary team from the German Bundesliga

### My background

I am a Data Scientist, working at [Deep Solutions](http://www.deep-solutions.net/), with a background (M.Sc) in Neuroscience, NLP, Vision Research, Optics and non-linear microscopy. Besides that, I think that machine learning, statistical signal processing and inference on graphical data are really cool...
