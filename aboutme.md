My name is Noam Cohen. When not geeking around I really like:
- Crossfit, Rockclimbing, traveling and any extreme sports
- Electronic music and espescially Bass
- Werder Bremen (!) the legendary team from the German Bundesliga

### My background

I am Data Scientist with background (M.Sc) in Neuroscience, NLP, Vision Research
,Optics and non-linear microscopy. Besides that, I think that machine learning,
statistical signal processing and inference on graphical data are really cool...
